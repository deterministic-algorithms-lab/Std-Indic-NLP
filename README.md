# Standardizing Indic NLP

**This Repo is in development stage currently.**

The purpose of this repository is to provide scripts for downloading various Indic NLP datasets and converting them into a standard format, to enable easy merging and processing of datasets. To allow training of different models, without changing the structure of data much.

## Points to Note

1.) By default, the files must not be split into train, test, valid dataset. 

2.) "**Dataset in standard format**" is shortened to "**standard dataset**" everywhere else in this repo.

3.) Look through the ```README.md``` and ```CONTRIBUTING.md``` above and inside the folder corresponding to the NLP task, to understand usage/contribute.

4.) See [Projects](https://github.com/deterministic-algorithms-lab/Std-Indic-NLP/projects) if you want to contribute to already planned tasks. 

5.) **Kindly open a new issue whenever you want to add a new dataset/cleaner/task and discuss changes, and search through pull-requests to make sure that no one else is working on the same thing already.**

## Installation

To get it up and running for development, run the following commands :
```
$ git clone https://github.com/deterministic-algorithms-lab/Std-Indic-NLP
$ cd Std-Indic-NLP
$ pip install -e ./
```
