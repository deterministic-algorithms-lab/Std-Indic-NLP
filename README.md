# Stanardizing Indic NLP

## Points to Note

1.) By default, the files must not be split into train, test, valid dataset. 

2.) "**Dataset in standard format**" is shortened to "**standard dataset**" everywhere else in this repo.

3.) Look through the ```README.md``` and ```CONTRIBUTING.md``` above and inside the folder corresponding to the NLP task, to understand usage/contribute.
