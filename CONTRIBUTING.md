## Adding a Task

To add a new task, create a new folder for that task, directly under ```Std-Indic-NLP```.

1.) That folder must have a ```README.md``` detailing the most common file structure for that particular task.

2.) Must also have a ```CONTRIBUTING.md``` & ```template.py``` detailing how other dataset can be added.

## Cleaning & Utilities

1.) Add task specific utilities and cleaning processes in their respective ```cleaners.py``` and ```utils.py``` files.

2.) Add general utilities and functions in ```Std-Indic-NLP/utils.py``` or ```Std-Indic-NLP/cleaners.py```.
